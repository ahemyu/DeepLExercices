If I told you I'm at pixel position (row=5, col=5) in your array,
and my tile_size=10, which tile am I in? How would you calculate the tile coordinates from the pixel coordinates?



for resolution = 20, tile_size = 5

Pixel at position (0, 0) - which tile? What color? - First tile black
Pixel at position (0, 5) - which tile? What color? second tile, white (bc we have resolution/tile_size tiles per row)
Pixel at position (5, 0) - which tile? What color? - 5th total tile, white
Pixel at position (7, 12) - which tile? What color? still 5th tile, white?
